<p>Upon calling in ENTITLEMENT for The Death of the Library, we are presented with one final puzzle: entitlement to what?
Aside from the list of the emoji at the top, we have 11 minipuzzles that look suspiciously like content from each
of the puzzles in the round.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we quickly begin to realize that these minipuzzles aren't quite solvable as-is. But with
some helpful <i>entitlement</i>—matching one of the emoji sets to the title of a book by one of the Death of the
Library authors—we can gain information we can plug into each minipuzzle to solve it! To aid in identification, the
book titles are given in alphabetical order.</p>
<table><tr><th>Emoji</th><th>Title</th><th>Author</th></tr><tr><td>🧠➡️🗡️</td><td><i>A Mind to Murder</i></td><td>P.D. James</td></tr><tr><td>⬇️🚣</td><td><i>Down at the Dinghy</i></td><td>J.D.

<p>Now we can move on to the subpuzzles:</p>
<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>A Mind to Murder</i></h4>

<p>The given word, DR. (styled as the abbreviation) is the first word of <i>A Mind to Murder</i>. In accordance with
the original puzzle, we extract an A.</p>
<h3>Poly Lines</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats</i></h4>
<p><i>Cats: The Musical</i> is famously based on this collection of poems by T.S. Eliot. The only song that fits the
given enumeration (and has two brief singing parts followed by a long section of speaking in unison) is "The Naming of
Cats". We extract an M.</p>
<h3>Through the Looking-Glass</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>The Ill-Made Knight</i></h4>

<p>Alice notes that there is a piece missing, and that white has already completed a checkmate. The only square the missing
knight can occupy to force a checkmate is g7 on World B. Taking the corresponding letter from the World B extraction board
gives an E.</p>
<h3>The Launch of This Puzzle Has Been Delayed</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>The Time Machine</i></h4>

<p>The Time Traveler's target year can be calculated through Ohm's Law, then by noting that power is equal to current times voltage.</p>
<p>\(I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{7759.056\textrm{V}}{15\textrm{Ω}}=517.2704\textrm{A}\)</p>
<p>\(P=IV=(517.2704\textrm{A})(7759.056\textrm{V})=4013530.00074\textrm{W}\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{4013530.00074\textrm{W}}{5\textrm{W/yr}}\approx802706\textrm{ years}\)</p>

<p>The space telescope launched July 1, 2023 is EUCLID, which uses the mirror arrangement pictured in the diagram. Taking
the difference between the Time Traveler's calculated year (802706) and the year he makes it to in the novel (802701)
yields 5, so we extract an I.</p>
<h3>Flight of the Babelbees</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>The Silver Chair</i></h4>

<p>Silver is an HTML color with a set code (#c0c0c0), so we can calculate the distance between the silver hex and the
#c0c140 hex. Expressed in base-36, this distance is S0, so we extract an S.</p>
<h3>🔍🔍🔍</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>Everworld 1: Search for Senna</i></h4>

<p>For this minipuzzle, we simply repeat the extraction step of the original: searching the Library for SENNA yields a
page filled with the letter T.</p>
<h3>Eight Cells</h3>
<h4>Poem used: <i>The Second Coming</i></h4>

<p>The 8-cells puzzle divides into 4 8-cube regions (colors are arbitrary). One possible logical solution path can be found
in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zoGKhoCTmmY1kMcdig-tcr6LSywwYiYV9UShV04ZhwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

<p>The region indicated by the + is <a href="https://whuts.org/unfolding/142" target="_blank">hypercube net #142</a> on
the WHUTS website. But this time, instead of the first-place solver, we want
the one who comes in second! This is Zac Wilson, so we extract a W.</p>
<h3>Folk Wisdom</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>Ragnarok: the End of the Gods</i></h4>

<p>The audio file given here has no song, only the sound of turning pages. We can also resolve the rebus to A.S. Byatt
(A'S + BUY + AT), plus a few extra images as usual, so we can reasonably conclude that the folk song in this minipuzzle
has been replaced with the book written by Byatt. (This is further confirmed by the proverb clued by the leftover images:
"To fall from the ox onto the rear end of an ass", or "To fall on hard times".) There's no loop here, but we should again
index the title of the song-turned-book using the number of images in the proverb, giving us an N.</p>
<h3>How the Turntables</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>The Outsiders</i></h4>

<p>Mr. Syme is a TEACHER in <i>The Outsiders</i>. Applying the turntables to obtain the antigram ((CH)(EA)T)ER
and extracting the starred letter gives us an H.</p>
<h3>Elementary</h3>
<h4>Book used: <i>Mary Poppins in the Park</i></h4>

<p>The Agatha Christie novel clued in this incident report is <i>Dumb Witness</i>, which involves a poisoning using
phosphorus. Unfortunately, when we wrote this puzzle, we used the incorrect spelling "phosphorous", and by the time
this was pointed out to us, we were several days into the the hunt with no good way to fix it. The rest of this solution
assumes "phosphorous" is the correct spelling.</p>
<p>To determine the path, we know that the full path must cross through a park twice (one bus and one taxi) without
revisiting any stops, which means we must be in Kensington Gardens / Hyde Park in the west of the Scotland Yard map. The
bus-bus sequence between the two park visits must be 124-123-122, which orients our path and allows us to place the
section approaching the train station as 122-95-94-(74 or 93). However, we can't then leave 93 by bus, so we must be at
74. The remaining bus-taxi-taxi-taxi-bus sequence (looping around to the beginning) must be 74-58-59-76-77. (The only
bus connection forward from 74 that we haven't used is 58, and the only 3-long taxi chain between 58 and 77—the other
side of the bus route at 124—is 58-59-76-77.) The full path is therefore 76-77-124-123-122-95-94-74-58-59-76.</p>
<p>Element 76 is Osmium (Os); taking the letter between O and S in PHOSPHOROUS gives us U.</p>
<h3>Sandwich Shop</h3>
<h4>Story used: <i>Down at the Dinghy</i></h4>

<p>The craft in <i>Down at the Dinghy</i> is, obviously, a dinghy—the sharp-ended cod-fishing subset of these are DORIES.
A dory is clearly a quiche, so taking the letter in the third position in DORIES gives us an R.</p>
<h3>Final Extraction</h3>
<p>As we were filling in our titles, we probably noticed that a given minipuzzle uses a book other than the one
written by its answer-author. This gives us a chain with which to order our letters, and extract the final

    <p><b>Adeline: </b>Even after The Death of the Library was finalized, this puzzle when through a great many iterations. One of the
        first was a ridiculously long slog that involved constructing cryptic clues out of words from 36 book titles and
        the 11 puzzle titles, and cryptics remained a core mechanic for the meta for nearly every draft afterwards. We
        went back and forth over this decision for...probably about a year and a half, with (cryptic metas are
        apparently a bit contentious), but eventually (about two months before hunt) we decided we had to scrap it. We
        tossed around another set of fascinating puzzle ideas, which I won't spoil here in case people ever want to use
        them, but we couldn't quite make any of them work. We resigned ourselves to whittling away at ideas until
        something stuck, or maybe turning around and returning sadly to the cryptics...</p>
    <p>And then Ella visited me in New York one weekend, and we got to talking, and then we wrote the entire meta from
        scratch over the course of twelve hours. The only part we kept was the emojified titles.</p>
    <p>I do think this meta has a lot going for it! One of the strengths of throwback metas is that they can feel more
        capstone-y by nature, which was one of the concerns we had about the cryptics. We wrote the puzzles somewhat
        prioritizing humor (one of my favorite tiny details is the single-letter extraction blank in the PDF for The
        Launch of This Mini Has Been Delayed), so we hope solvers had fun going back and applying puzzle mechanics in
        ways they may not have been expecting. (And if it prompted an extra forward-solve or two, so much the
        better.)</p>
    <p>(I should also mention that the original impetus for the chaining mechanic was my desire to reference <i>Cats:
        the Musical</i> for the Poly Lines mini—we had a musical puzzle, and we had T.S. Eliot, so how could we not?)
    </p>
    <p>The tight time constraints did force us to make a few suboptimal decisions, though. It still pains me that we
        couldn't work in a way to use A.S. Byatt's <i>Babel Tower</i> (in combination with Bruegel the Elder's <i>The
            Tower of Babel</i>!), but that would have involved rewriting most of the minis to extract to different
        letters, and by the time we realized that both of those items existed, we were a few weeks out from hunt and
        already locked in. Still, I found the process of writing this puzzle was one of the most delightful of the hunt
        (not least because it was, well, short), so I hope it brought the people solving it at least some of the
        amusement we experienced while writing.</p>

    <p><b>Ella: </b>
        So spending 12 straight hours redrafting the second half of the round 3 meta wasn't exactly how I expected we
        would spend our time when Addie invited me to spend the weekend in New York, but in hindsight it really should
        have been. There was nowhere I could go to escape the overwhelming influence of Shardhunt brainrot.</p>
    <p>To be clear, it was fun! The nice thing about a callback meta is that the process of construction leaves you with
        a greater appreciation for everyone else's puzzles - I definitely ended construction feeling much better about
        the impressiveness of Shardhunt than I had at the beginning, which was in the midst of a low point in terms of
        everyone's hunt burnout. Writing this meta reminded me of how many really cool puzzles we have in this round,
        and how amazing all my fellow writers are. About 3-4 hours of the 12 hour process were just spent trying to
        backwards rederive the Babelbees math while the author was asleep in a different timezone, and that honestly way
        more fun that I expected it would be. (No one better let me convert to a math major, okay?)</p>
    <p>Of course, Addie and I were also various levels of sleep deprived and delirious while writing this, with the
        chaos that you would expect. A good fraction of the minis were kept just because we both thought that they were
        hilarious while writing them at 3 am (and I still stand by this now). One of my favorite minis ended up getting
        scrapped when we gave up on our overly ambitious Sandwich Shop plan, but I will forever mourn the fact that we
        didn't get to use JD Salinger's short story "This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise".</p>
    <p>My personal favorite story about this puzzle didn't come from our 12-hour marathon, however, but from during our
        subsequent full-hunt testsolve. (Pause for testsolver appreciation! They were amazing and we couldn't have done
        this without them.) I had originally wanted to use another notable space telescope mirror for the Launch mini,
        ideally Hubble, mostly because I thought it would be really funny to "assemble" a mirror grid that's just a
        single circle. Unfortunately, we couldn't get the extraction letter to work out for it, so I resigned myself to
        losing the bit and just made a single hex to extract from. Flash forward to the testsolve a few weeks later, and
        I opened my news feed to see a launch announcement for the Euclid Space Telescope, the latest space telescope to
        launch after JWST. (I was actually somewhat devastated, because I'd been planning to watch the launch live and
        had gotten so wrapped up in the testsolve that I'd forgotten. But that disappointment was soon overwhelmed by
        puzzle excitement!) Euclid was 6 letters long, contained the letter we needed, and lined up perfectly with
        Launch's central theme of proceeding chronologically through the history of aviation and spaceflight! I'm not
        sure if our testsolvers realized the implications of the fact that the telescope had been launched the day
        before they solved the puzzle, but I had a <i>great</i> time frantically texting Addie behind the scenes about
        changing it. It makes the space nerd in me very happy that this got to run.</p>
