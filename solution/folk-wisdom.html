<p>The solvers begin with a list of audio files, grouped, and a list of rebuses. The first thing that the solvers may feel
inclined to do is to identify the songs and who sang them. Doing so results in the following list:</p>
<table><tr><th>Lyric</th><th>Song</th><th>Artist</th></tr><tr><td>And to those gods I will speak bluntly / We've an accord / If you ever touch or harm him / Please rest
            assured / That you might not fear a man / But to a woman by the end you'll kneel and plead
        </td><td>Inkpot Gods</td><td>The Amazing Devil</td></tr><tr><td>Once upon a time you dressed so fine / Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?</td><td>Like a Rolling Stone</td><td>Bob Dylan</td></tr><tr><td>You know we kept on missing / So try and try again</td><td>Live & Learn</td><td>Clannad</td></tr><tr><td>Lie to me if you will / At the top of Beringer Hill / Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do</td><td>Ragged Wood</td><td>Fleet Foxes</td></tr><tr><td>People talking without speaking / People hearing without listening / People writing songs that voices never
            shared
        </td><td>The Sound of Silence</td><td>Simon & Garfunkel</td></tr><tr><td>We were tight knit boys / Brothers in more than name / You would kill for me / And knew that I'd do the
            same
        </td><td>Always Gold</td><td>Radical Face</td></tr><tr><td>She can bake a cherry pie / Quick as a cat can wink his eye</td><td>Billy Boy</td><td>Nina & Frederick</td></tr><tr><td>And I can't keep it in, I can't hide it / and I can't lock it away</td><td>Can't Keep it In</td><td>Cat Stevens</td></tr><tr><td>You're a reckless driver / And one day it'll kill us if I don't let go</td><td>reckless driving</td><td>Lizzy McAlpine</td></tr><tr><td>For you'll need your wits about you when you run against the grain</td><td>Againt the Grain</td><td>The Irish Rovers</td></tr><tr><td>Meddling fools, meddling fools / Don't you meddle with me</td><td>Cooltide</td><td>John Martyn</td></tr><tr><td>Only know you love her when you let her go / and you let her go</td><td>Let Her Go</td><td>Passenger</td></tr><tr><td>It looks like we might sing all night, but looks are deceiving</td><td>Wonderful Friends</td><td>Pete Seeger</td></tr><tr><td>One lived in luxury and riches / And the other one begged for his bread</td><td>A Picture From Life's Other Side Lyrics</td><td>Woody Guthrie</td></tr><tr><td>I keep my tears in bottles / In case if I need them later / You never know / You never know</td><td>In Bottles</td><td>AURORA</td></tr><tr><td>The words I speak are wildfires and weeds / They spread like some awful damn disease</td><td>Allies or Enemies</td><td>The Crane Wives</td></tr><tr><td>But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life</td><td>Cleopatra</td><td>The Lumineers</td></tr><tr><td>But you can’t go from fry cook to the Opry overnight / So stay up in that saddle, you may join the chosen
            few / But for now you’ll sweat it out and sing the food truck blues
        </td><td>Food Truck Blues</td><td>Arcadian Wild</td></tr><tr><td>I said to my wife, my pretty little wife, explain this thing to me / What's this head doing here on the
            pillow case where my head ought to be?

<p>The rebuses are less immediately intuitive. Understanding what to do with these requires two key observations. The first
is that the flavor text indicaes that there is "extra imagery" in the puzzle - this may indicate to solvers that there
are some images in the rebuses that won't be immediately useful. Armed with this knowledge, they can then begin to
realize that each rebus has a set of images that corresponds to one of the singers of the songs in the audio files,
with some number of extra images. The phrase "count on" in the flavor text indicates that the number of extra images is
relevant.</p>
<p>At this stage, the solvers now have some lists of strings associated with numbers. There's nothing to do but index!
The song titles have not yet been used, so it is natural to attempt to index into them. The rebus order appears arbitrary,
so using this as the extraction ordering makes sense.</p>
<table><tr><th>Rebus Answer</th><th>Parse</th><th># of Extra Images</th><th>Song Title</th></tr><tr><td>John Martyn</td><td>[Lyndon B] Johnson - son, Mars - S[ulfur] + tin</td><td>1</td><td><span class="ext-letter">C</span>OOLTIDE</td></tr><tr><td>The Oh Hellos</td><td>O, hell + multiple Os</td><td>4</td><td>WIS<span class="ext-letter">H</span>ING WELL</td></tr><tr><td>Radical Face</td><td>Face emoji beneath a radical (nth root) symbol</td><td>1</td><td><span class="ext-letter">A</span>LWAYS GOLD</td></tr><tr><td>Dolly Parton</td><td>Doll + E, part + on</td><td>1</td><td><span class="ext-letter">I</span>F I HAD WINGS</td></tr><tr><td>The Amazing Devil</td><td>A + maze + ingot - ot, devil</td><td>2</td><td>I<span class="ext-letter">N</span>KPOT GODS</td></tr><tr><td>Nina & Frederick</td><td>"ni" (from Monty Python and the Holy Grail) + Na (sodium), &, free - e + Derek (from the Good Place)</td><td>3</td><td>BI<span class="ext-letter">L</span>LY BOY</td></tr><tr><td>The Eagles</td><td>Multiple eagles</td><td>2</td><td>L<span class="ext-letter">Y</span>IN' EYES</td></tr><tr><td>Lizzy McAlpine</td><td>Liz (from the Magic Schoolbus) + E, "Mc" (McDonalds menu) + mountains (alpine)</td><td>1</td><td><span class="ext-letter">R</span>ECKLESS DRIVING</td></tr><tr><td>Bob Dylan</td><td>Bob (the haircut), dill + N</td><td>2</td><td>L<span class="ext-letter">I</span>KE A ROLLING STONE</td></tr><tr><td>The Lumineers</td><td>Loom "in" (between) two ears</td><td>1</td><td><span class="ext-letter">C</span>LEOPATRA</td></tr><tr><td>Cat Stevens</td><td>Cat, St (street) + evens (even numbers)</td><td>4</td><td>CAN'<span class="ext-letter">T</span> KEEP IT IN</td></tr><tr><td>Pete Seeger</td><td>Pets + E (east), eager beaver - beaver</td><td>2</td><td>W<span class="ext-letter">O</span>NDERFUL FRIENDS</td></tr><tr><td>AURORA</td><td>"Oar or A"</td><td>3</td><td>IN <span class="ext-letter">B</span>OTTLES</td></tr><tr><td>Arcadian Wild</td><td>Arcade + Ian [McKellan],  Y+old</td><td>6</td><td>FOOD T<span class="ext-letter">R</span>UCK BLUES</td></tr><tr><td>The Weavers</td><td>Multiple people weaving</td><td>3</td><td>YO<span class="ext-letter">U</span> OLD FOOL</td></tr><tr><td>The Arrogant Worms</td><td>Arrow + G + ant, multiple worms</td><td>3</td><td>TH<span class="ext-letter">E</span> LAST SASKATCHEWAN PIRATE</td></tr><tr><td>The Irish Rovers</td><td>Multiple Mars rovers carrying Irish flags</td><td>2</td><td>A<span class="ext-letter">G</span>AINST THE GRAIN</td></tr><tr><td>Simon & Garfunkel</td><td>SI (units) + moon - O, Garf (first half of Garfield) + uncle</td><td>3</td><td>TH<span class="ext-letter">E</span> SOUND OF SILENCE</td></tr><tr><td>The Crane Wives</td><td>Multiple brides standing beside cranes</td><td>2</td><td>A<span class="ext-letter">L</span>LIES OR ENEMIES</td></tr><tr><td>Woody Guthrie</td><td>Wood + E, gut + three</td><td>2</td><td>A <span class="ext-letter">P</span>ICTURE FROM LIFE'S OTHER SIDE LYRICS</td></tr><tr><td>Fleet Foxes</td><td>Foxes on a fleet of ships</td><td>1</td><td><span class="ext-letter">R</span>AGGED WOOD</td></tr><tr><td>The Decemberists</td><td>Decides - ides + ember + multiple wrists</td><td>4</td><td>WE B<span class="ext-letter">O</span>TH GO DOWN TOGETHER</td></tr><tr><td>Clannad</td><td>Cl (chlorine) + anna + d (diameter)</td><td>3</td><td>LI<span class="ext-letter">V</span>E & LEARN</td></tr><tr><td>Passenger</td><td>Passenger in a car</td><td>2</td><td>L<span class="ext-letter">E</span>T HER GO</td></tr><tr><td>The Longest Johns</td><td>Four characters named John - two have been stretched, two squished, with the stretched ones indicated</td><td>6</td><td>WAYFA<span class="ext-letter">R</span>ING STRANGER</td></tr><tr><td>Mumford & Sons</td><td>Mum + fjord - j, &, multiple suns</td><td>3</td><td>BA<span class="ext-letter">B</span>EL</td></tr></table>

<p>The resulting cluephrase from this step is CHAIN LYRIC TO BRUEGEL PROVERB. Googling the phrase "bruegel proverb" gives
the painting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlandish_Proverbs" target="_blank">Netherlandish Proverbs</a>,
with a handy Wikipedia page that contains a lot of nicely sorted data. (Sharp-eyed solvers will also connect the
capitalization of "Elders" in the flavor text to "Peter Bruegel the Elder.) At this point, the extra images in each
rebus start to make sense. Each of them can map to a proverb from the painting, resulting in an association between
songs and proverbs.</p>
<p>In order to form a chain, solvers should realize that they need a second association for each proverb/lyric pair. At
this point they may realize that the meanings of the songs line up with the meanings of the proverbs, and that they can
associate them that way. The groupings of the lyrics indicate a self-contained chain (which can be easily discovered
from the associations between the pair In Bottles and A Picture From Life's Other Side). This will result in a set of
chains that looks like this:</p>
<table class="chaining"><tr><th>Proverb 1 (Rebus)</th><th>Proverb 1 Meaning</th><th>Artist</th><th>Song title</th><th>Song lyric</th><th>Proverb 2 Meaning</th><th>Proverb 2 (Song, for chaining)</th></tr><tr><td>The world is turned upside down</td><td>Everything is the opposite of what it should be</td><td>Bob Dylan</td><td>Like a Rolling Stone</td><td><div>Once upon a time you dressed so fine / Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?</div></td><td>To be very wealthy</td><td>To have the roof tiled with tarts</td></tr><tr><td>To have the roof tiled with tarts</td><td>To be very wealthy</td><td>Fleet Foxes</td><td>Ragged Wood</td><td><div>Lie to me if you will / At the top of Beringer Hill / Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do

<p>The solvers have now nearly finished this massive puzzle! All that they need to do now is extract. The solvers have
chaining associations, and the one piece of information from the painting that they haven't used is the position of
the proverb on the painting. The last thing to do is to draw the chaining connections onto the painting itself. Doing
so will get an image that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../static/solution_resources/folk-wisdom/painting.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>These shapes can be read as letters: ADVICE. They can call it in!</p>
<p>Hahahaha, they thought they were done. Nope, it's action submission. Once they submit an image of themselves interpreting
a proverb literally, they can get their actual answer: <span class="spoiler">WHISKEY BOTTLE</span>.</p>

    <b>Ella: </b>
    This puzzle, as you may be able to guess, was born from a dataset. I mean come on, no puzzler can open the
    Netherlandsih Proverbs wikipedia page and not immediately see the puzzle potential. The question then simply became
    what to do with this dataset. My ideas went through a lot of iterations before settling into the monstrosity you see
    today - let's just say that I've spent more time staring at this painting than would perhaps be considered "reasonable"
    or "sane".
</p>
<p>
    When I was constructing this puzzle, there were concerns among the writing team that no one would want to solve such
    a long puzzle, particularly one with such a heavy audio component. The original version of this puzzle had 36
    song/proverb pairs, rather than the unfortunately red-herringy 26 that we pared it down to, and arguments were made
    that this was simply too much to expect anyone to sift through. My response to this was, largely invariably,
    "let the solvers suffer", and I stand by this sentiment.
</p>
<p>
    The question on your mind at this point is probably "but how did you even go about finding
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through">36</span> 26 folk songs with lyrics that corresponded to the meanings of
    antiquated Dutch proverbs?" The answer is many, many hours spent on <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/" target="_blank">
    azlyrics.com</a>, collectively losing our minds. If anyone has a tool that can sort songs by meaning, please send it
    our way, because we were manually sifting through entire artist discographies. Huge credit has to go to my coauthor
    Addie, who agreed to join me on this fool's errand after seeing the madness that was my partially filled out construction
    spreadsheet - however deranged that I may seem now, know that I would have been much worse without her working
    tirelessly with me. I also want to thank Olga, who isn't listed as an author on this puzzle but who provided invaluable
    help in going through our lyric connections and flagging all the ones that were a little too dubious to work outside
    of our own heads. There's a lot of risk with a puzzle mechanic as subjective as this one, and testsolving feedback
    was the only way that we got it to work as well as it does.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, what helped with constructing this puzzle is the fact that Addie and I are both big fans of folk music in
    general. We were definitely doing some finagling of the data to try and fit in our favorite bands. Out of the musical
    groups in this puzzle, I can highly recommend the following: The Oh Hellos (particularly their 4 Winds album cycle),
    the Arcadian Wild, Simon & Garfunkel, The Crane Wives, The Amazing Devil, AURORA, Fleet Foxes, The Lumineers, and
    Mumford and Sons. I will also shout out Of Monsters and Men as a favorite band that I was unfortunately unable to
    fit into this puzzle.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the day, I am honestly astonished that we managed to get this puzzle working. There were many points
    at which I thought we were going to need to throw the whole thing out and start from scratch, but somehow it pulled
    through - and of that I'm very pleased. Possibly no one else will be quite as tickled by the combination of the
    datasets as I was, but I hope there are at least a few solvers that come away from this puzzle with a new
    appreciation for folk music, Peter Bruegel the Elder, or both.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Adeline: </b>
    Despite what Ella seems to suggest, it required basically zero effort to convince to me join up—I saw the puzzle
    title in our master planning sheet, went, "Oh, a folk song puzzle?", and immediately offered myself for whatever
    help might be needed.
</p>
<p>
    I was immediately sold on the core puzzle mechanic (the linking of song lyrics to proverb
    meanings), but as it turns out, this kind of thing is hard to make unambiguous in a puzzle context. Something Ella
    didn't mention is that our early drafts involved solvers finding the groupings themselves (the songs were presented
    as an alpha-ordered list of 36)—and while I and my terminal literary-analysis-brain agreed this should be possible, it
    turns out such fickle things as <i>meanings</i> are "subjective" and "open to the listener's interpretation". Who would
    have thought?
</p>
<p>
    In terms of folk artists that I recommend, I have pretty much the same list as Ella: I came into this puzzle knowing
    (and loving) The Amazing Devil, The Oh Hellos, The Arcadian Wild, and The Crane Wives, and The Longest Johns; I came
    out with basically half the artists on our final list. I did try for ages to fit "Puff, the Magic Dragon" (by Peter,
    Paul, and Mary) into the puzzle, but was unfortunately stymied by the lack of relevant proverbs in good locations.
    Nevertheless, I recommend them too.
