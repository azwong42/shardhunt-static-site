    <div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.2em;">
Hi my name is KarAO3ke Shard'hunt Floor-Two Audio Puzzle and I have long karaoke sound clips (that’s how I got my name) with
missing lyrics and red sections that last about the length of one line and a weird audio player that may have caused
tears and a lot of people tell me I look like AO3 (AN: if u don’t know what that is get da hell out of here!). I’m not
related to any of the Floor 1 Puzzles but I wish I was because they're all major fucking hotties. I’m an audio puzzle
but I don't actually have words. I have the missing red lyrics. Those are important, and finding them leads you to a
magic site called Archive of Our Own on the Internet where I have a bunch of fics in a bunch of years (I’m only two years
old, though). That's a cluephrase (in case you couldn’t tell) telling you to USE FIC TITLE. I love movies and TV shows
and I get all my scene descriptions from there. For example the first one is titled "rising up, back on the street"
and it features a boy from the Umbrella Academy and his name is Number Five and the scene in the fanfic has Istanbul
(Not Constantinople) playing over it and that's a song from another one of the karaoke clips. I connected them all so
you can put them all in a loop. I put some numbers in the fics. The numbers indexed the fic titles,
which I was very happy about. Two words stared back at me. I got the <span class="spoiler">ANSWER (RUMOR)</span> from them.
</div>
<hr><div></div>
<p>Alright, alright, have an actual solution.</p>
<p>This puzzle consists of a series of videos, where an instrumental version of a song plays beneath some interestingly-formatted text.
Most of the songs should be identifiable by memory or through an audio ID tool such as Shazam, while the images are recognizable (perhaps
with some careful googling of the puzzle title) as story titles from the fanfiction archive AO3 (Archive of Our Own).</p>
<p>The titles themselves, which are redacted, align with the missing lyrics from the karaoke songs. (Fics on AO3 are noted for using song
lyrics as their titles—so much so that it's frequently possible to make
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3z2uUD7p3WATNmE77kx-QMEpz0u0BvU" target="_blank">lyric videos</a> using them.) Solvers should therefore
note that the lyrics are important; in particular, the specific line highlighted in red in each video. These are:</p>
<table><tr><th>Video</th><th>Song</th><th>Lyric</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Eye of the Tiger</td><td>Rising up, back on the street</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Hooked on a Feeling</td><td>Everything's alright</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Highway to Hell</td><td>Asking nothing</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Carry On Wayward Son</td><td>Don't you cry no more</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Istanbul (Not Constantinople)</td><td>Even old New York was once New Amsterdam</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Stayin' Alive</td><td>And now it's alright, it's okay</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Twist and Shout</td><td>Come on, come on, come, come on, baby, now (come on, baby)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Dancing Queen</td><td>Having the time of your life</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>All-Star</td><td>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>The Lion Sleeps Tonight</td><td>In the jungle, the mighty jungle</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Bohemian Rhapsody</td><td>Caught in a landslide</td></tr></table>

<p>Reading down the first letters of each lyric gives READ EACH FIC, suggesting that we should find actual fics with these titles
on the AO3 website. If solvers are familiar with the AO3 tagging system, or simply willing to investigate the search options,
some limiting factors should be obvious: all of the fics are by anonymous authors, have a rating of G, have multiple or nonspecific
category tags, have been tagged "No Archive Warnings Apply", and are listed as completed. A bit of trial and error (even with these
constraints, some of these names are very popular!) should yield the proper fics. Solvers may also note the publication dates,
which are displayed in the same view as the lyric titles—all of these fics were published on January 1, though the years differ.</p>
<p>The actual content of the fics are vague descriptions of scenes, followed by a sentence that begins "Take the number . . .". All of these
scenes are from movies or TV shows, during which a <i>different</i> song from this puzzle is playing in the soundtrack. These are:</p>
<table><tr><th>Fic</th><th>Movie/Show</th><th>Number</th><th>Song Playing in Scene</th><th>Year of Posting</th></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36242989" target="_blank">rising up, back on the street</a></td><td><i>The Umbrella Academy</i> (S1E1)</td><td>3 (5 - 2) - the boy is known as Number Five</td><td><a href="https://vimeo.com/318074923" target="_blank">Istanbul (Not Constantinople)</a></td><td>2021</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243589" target="_blank">everything's alright</a></td><td><i>Wayne's World</i></td><td>4 (80% of 5) - there are five people headbanging in the car</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyJOnasHVE" target="_blank">Bohemian Rhapsody</a></td><td>2019</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243619" target="_blank">asking nothing</a></td><td><i>Shrek</i></td><td>8 (4 * 2) - Shrek Forever After is the fourth Shrek installment</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em9lziI07M4" target="_blank">All-Star</a></td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243250" target="_blank">don't you cry no more</a></td><td><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i></td><td>9 (((1 + 9 + 7 + 3) / 2) - 1) - Peter Quill says the year 1973 as the guard tazes him</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiMBgKgvGII" target="_blank">Hooked on a Feeling</a></td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243442" target="_blank">even old new york was once new amsterdam</a></td><td><i>The Lion King</i></td><td>10 (5 * 2) - Their trio's down to two</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ0VLni5QCg" target="_blank">The Lion Sleeps Tonight</a></td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243394" target="_blank">and now it's alright, it's okay</a></td><td><i>Mamma Mia!</i></td><td>1 (3 / 3) - Sophie has three potential fathers</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRoWiTcO7dk" target="_blank">Dancing Queen</a></td><td>2003</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243538" target="_blank">come on, come on, come, come on, baby, now (come on, baby)</a></td><td><i>Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</i></td><td>3 - Percy, Annabeth, and Grover</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsqGTt7itIs" target="_blank">Highway to Hell</a></td><td>2020</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243667" target="_blank">having the time of your life</a></td><td><i>Rocky III</i></td><td>5 - Rocky V is the highest-numbered mainline Rocky movie</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhoU-RoMZWo" target="_blank">Eye of the Tiger</a></td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243178" target="_blank">fed to the rules and i hit the ground running</a></td><td><i>Saturday Night Fever</i></td><td>9 (2 + 7) - He buys two slices and says the paint cost $7.98</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfwQ_7xqO7Y" target="_blank">Stayin' Alive</a></td><td>2020</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243226" target="_blank">in the jungle, the mighty jungle</a></td><td><i>Supernatural</i> (S15E20, the final episode)</td><td>5 (6  - 1) - the man's full first name is Samuel</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DymcBDZ6xoY" target="_blank">Carry On Wayward Son</a></td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36243340" target="_blank">caught in a landslide</a></td><td><i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</i></td><td>3 - the holiday is Von Steuben Day</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ZtmBAA_NE" target="_blank">Twist and Shout</a></td><td>2005</td></tr></table>

<p>Some of the publication years are clearly outrageous—there's no way this puzzle has been seeded since 2003! Converting the years
(minus 2000) to letters using A1Z26 yields USE FIC TITLE. The fic titles are the song lyrics, so we index into them using the numbers
associated with their movie scenes. Associating scenes with lyrics forms a closed cycle; ordering by this cycle yields the phrase
<span class="spoiler">ANSWER RUMOR</span>.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    
<p>Obviously, this puzzle was inspired by the "AO3 sings" tumblr/YouTube meme. Once the theming was solid, seeding puzzle data on AO3
itself seemed like a natural next step. I'd say I'm sorry for making solvers delve the depths of the Archive, but, well—I'm really not.
Fanworks and fan creations are art just like any other type, and they should be treated as such, from wonder and appreciation
all the way to meaningful and thoughtful critique of both the works themselves and their ecosystem.</p>

<p>Of the songs used for this puzzle, only three
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=575iWpSQRy8" target="_blank">Carry On Wayward Son</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn4E2EEw_wo" target="_blank">All-Star</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EVslhGH3pk" target="_blank">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>),
actually have full-length title lyric videos on YouTube. My personal favorite, which was not featured in the puzzle, is
the Mountain Goats' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-tmIxXRWp4" target="_blank">No Children</a>—if only for the sheer hilarity of the
number of fics titled "hand in unlovable hand".</p>
