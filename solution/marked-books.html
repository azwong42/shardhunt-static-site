<p>This is the metapuzzle for Floor 1. It uses the answers from the floor, which are:</p>
<table class = "summary"><tr><th>Puzzle</th><th>Answer</th></tr><tr><td>████████</td><td><span class="spoiler">REDACTED</span></td></tr><tr><td>Backbeat</td><td><span class="spoiler">SANDPIPER</span></td></tr><tr><td>Ha! That's a Classic!</td><td><span class="spoiler">DESECRATE</span></td></tr><tr><td>Join, or Die</td><td><span class="spoiler">HEARTACHE</span></td></tr><tr><td>Spelunking</td><td><span class="spoiler">HEADLIGHT</span></td></tr><tr><td>The Only Sanderson Puzzle</td><td><span class="spoiler">OUTBREAK</span></td></tr></table>

<p>As represented by the example diagram, each answer can form a different word by removing three of its letters.
These words are clued by images of books, which list the clues alphabetically on set of bookmarks—solvers should
therefore input the "bookmark" word into the Library's "Go to Bookmark" feature, which is available while browsing the Library.</p>
<p>The bookmarks are set to specific hexes; once there, the remaining three letters in each answer (taken in order) can be converted to
Wall, Shelf, and Volume numbers (indicated by W, S, and V) using A1Z26. Navigating to the specified volume, then to the
page number on the corresponding book image, yields a mostly-blank page with four sentences on it. (See
the <a href="marked-books.html#appendix">appendix</a> for a list of all of the text blocks).</p>
<p>Each sentence is actually a quote from a book with a number in its title. Using each title number as an index into its
corresponding puzzle answer and ordering by the location of the 4-sentence block on the Library page yields the
answer to the puzzle, <span class="spoiler">CHECK OUT THEIR CARD READERS</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    
<p><b>Thomas:</b> This was the great grand-daddy of all of the Shardhunt puzzles. It was written first in March 2021, far before any
    other puzzles which have survived to the final hunt, and motivated many other design decisions. Despite some minor changes 
    to the title, formatting, and books used in the final extraction, it has changed very little.</p>
<p>It may interest some to know that in the initial stages of writing the hunt (up until late 2021), this puzzle relied on the 
    actual Library of Babel website (indeed, plug in some of the bookmarks and see what you find)! However, when we were uncertain 
    about the stability of the site under the weight of hordes of puzzlers, we were faced with the possibility of either writing 
    a different metapuzzle, or building an infinitely large library on a python backend. I am still completely astounded at and 
    in awe of the fact that Addie actually pulled off the latter... <i>entirely on her own</i>. I just provided the wordplay 
    mechanic. She deserves so much praise for making this puzzle happen.</p>

<p><b>Adeline:</b> Technically, the Library implementation wasn't really done on my own—the actual generation algorithm is adapted from
    <a href="https://github.com/keiwando/libraryofbabel3D/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Libraries/OfflineLibrary.cs" target="_blank">
        Keiwan Donyagard's Offline Library</a>, which was originally written in C#.
    At some point during the process, I experienced a glorious few days where I
    actually understood how the algorithm worked, but two years later, that knowledge has vacated my head entirely.
</p><p>(Had I known that the existence of this puzzle would directly result in my futile attempts to decipher the utility of
    statements like <code>c = ((2 ** 11213) - 1) * ((2 ** 4253) - 1) * 2305843009213693951 * 8191 * 13</code>, I probably would have
    nixed it on sight. Luckily, 2021-me had no idea of the horrors in store for her.)

rst of times. in every enterprise is no greater evil than bad companionship.    </pre></div>

oud be amazed how much research you can get done when you have no life whatsoeve

<h4>REACT</h4>
<div class="library-page"><pre>you were born at a pretty crappy time in history. everything was beautiful and n

e cold reason which i place above all things. we talked the moon out of heavens
before either of us grew tired. it is necessary to do right it is not necessary
to be happy. there is prodigious strength in sorrow and despair.                </pre></div>
