<p>This puzzle takes the form of a Sokoban-esque game, where the player (represented by a comma) 
pushes around letters. Strings of letters disappear when they form a word.</p>
<h3>Part One: Learning the Rules</h3>

<p>The first few rooms of the game are intended to help the player understand the rules 
and how the game is structured. The first room teaches the player that words, when formed, 
will disappear; they progress by pushing the W up to form the string WORDS.</p>
<p>The second room teaches the player that words must be a minimum of four letters long to 
disappear. This is shown by having a three-letter word, STY, formed in the middle of the 
room, but not disappearing. The player progresses by creating the string STYMIED to remove the blockage.</p>
<p>(N.B.: The reason that there are spaces in the ‘tutorial text’ words is so those words 
don’t disappear either. There is no other reason for these spaces.)</p>
<p>The third room teaches the player that words must be valid Scrabble words in order to 
disappear. The player needs to get the letter Z to the other side of the room to form 
the word JAZZ, and thus will need to remove the letters that are blocking the way in 
the middle. Attempting to form ITALY will not cause the letters to disappear, because 
ITALY is not a valid Scrabble word.</p>
<p>The two valid Scrabble words that will cause the A and L blocking the path to disappear 
are ALIT and TALI. Forming either of these words will then allow the player to push the 
letter Z across the room and form JAZZ. A discerning player might also realize that JAZY 
is a Scrabble word, and thus use the Y to clear away the letters blocking the exit without 
needing to remove the A or the L.</p>
<p>Heading upwards, the next room is a “final exam” of sorts; there is a CO blocking the 
player’s exit, and the letters N, C, E, P, and T also in the room. However, if the
player attempts to make the word CONCEPT, the substring ONCE will 
disappear before they are able to complete the full word. The player must either 
counter-intuitively place the letter T first (so that finishing the substring 
ONCE will also complete the entire word), or find another word which fits the 
constraints of CO??, CO??E, or CO??EP. (CONTE works.)</p>
<p>The next room to the left is meant to teach the player something fundamental about 
the underlying logic of the game. The player’s goal is to get the letter U to the 
other side of the room to form the word QUIZ, thus letting them progress. However, 
the topology of the room means that the player can’t get the letter U to the other 
side of the room without getting it stuck against a wall in the process.</p>
<p>In the middle of the room, there is the letters O, R, and E, which can remove the 
letters S and H (which are blocking the path) by making SHORE or SHERO or SHOE or 
SHOER. However, in order to complete this room, the player must realize that the 
tiles that form the walls are letters as well; more specifically, they’re Xs! 
Thus, any string the player makes that contains an X and is also a valid Scrabble 
word will also delete that X “wall” tile. By forming the word XEROX, the player 
can clear holes in the walls to allow the U to be pushed to the other side of the 
room, forming the word QUIZ and clearing it.</p>
<p>Progressing into the next room, however, it seems the player is stuck. They can 
go no further in this direction; the entire path dead-ends. </p>
<p>They are, however, treated with a view of some letters in a room that they’ve 
never seen before, as well as a bunch of walls. The top row of the last few 
screens also spelled the phrase THE ANSWER IS, heading from left to right (while 
the player was traveling from right to left).</p>
<p>What can we do now?</p>
<h3>Part Two: Pushing the Rules</h3>

<p>As one might quickly work out, the fact that the player can delete wall tiles is 
actually incredibly powerful. The player’s goal is now to work out how they can 
break out-of-bounds and reach the right-most screens where the answer is (presumably) contained.</p>
<p>Tracing our way back through the game, the only place that we can punch a hole out 
of the map is in the second room. Instead of using the letters S, T, and Y to form 
the word STYMIED, the player can instead make the valid Scrabble word XYST, escaping 
into the space above this row of rooms. This lets the player access a space that 
contains a number of letters – B, C, C, E, E, E, I, R, and T – and three barriers 
beneath the top “row” of the map, which leads over to where the answer is written.</p>
<p>The player can reach this top row by (seemingly) forming three Scrabble words which 
start with X, thereby removing a tile from each barrier and letting the player pass 
through. The two four-letter Scrabble words that start with X – XRAY and XYST – 
aren’t possible, but two five-letter words – XEBEC and XERIC – are. That deals with 
two of the barriers, leaving only a leftover T to deal with the final barrier.</p>
<p>In order to deal with this final barrier, the player will need to use every source 
of letters available to them. The first source is the word THE, in the top-left; 
we can use the E as part of the word. We can also steal either an M or an I from 
the tutorial text (i.e. the word MINIMUM) by making the word XYST directly under 
that letter tile and pushing it away from the wall from below. Using these tricks, 
we have just enough letter tiles to form the word EXIT!</p>

<p>By forming the word EXIT, the player can then access the top row of the level map, 
and is then able to pass above the entire set of rooms and access where the answer 
is written, revealing the answer <span class="spoiler">BROAD</span>.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    

<p>There's a bit in The Princess Bride where Inigo's father is forging the sword, and it's a constant struggle; where each
    new small change throws the balance off, or makes the blade too short, and the whole thing has to be done and redone, again 
    and again, for the whole thing to be perfect. Writing this puzzle felt like that. The core a-ha was dreamed up briefly; but, 
    then, making the rest of the game work around it took painstaking trial and error, and the long-suffering sweat of many very 
    kind testsolvers. Thank you, testsolvers. You made this puzzle into what it is.
</p>

<p>For slightly silly reasons, every word that clears in this game is hand-coded. Some solvers got caught out by words that 
    should work, but don't; if you were one of those, I'm sorry! I tried to catch all of them. I failed, but generally enough 
    were caught to give most people the illusion of a properly constructed game.
</p>

<p>This puzzle was inspired by the works of the late Jack Lance.</p>
