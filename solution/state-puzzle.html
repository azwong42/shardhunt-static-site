<p>It turns out that each of the clues can also uniquely identify a state from a different country with a red, white, and blue flag: 
Australia!</p>
<p>We can identify the states and then index like so:</p>

<p>Which gives the cluephrase TENNESSEE MINERAL. Tennessee's official state mineral is <span class="spoiler">AGATE</span>, which is the answer.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> The story of this puzzle is fun. It was a little bit because I thought it would be neat, and a little bit because it played 
    into some untapped datasets, but it was primarily <i>revenge</i>.</p>

<p>Friends of mine will know that I didn't grow up in the United States; which means I have a personal vendetta (pointless and 
    all) against puzzles and hunts which assume, unclued, that solvers will have a familiarity with American culture. I'm not 
    talking about, like, TV shows. I mean stuff which only Americans would possibly know. Which is perfectly fine, but every now 
    and again, the puzzle doesn't bother to clue that the puzzle requires American knowledge; it will just assume that you 
    Are American. I remember making it to the end of one of these puzzles or another, not very long after writing for 
    Shardhunt started, and for one associated reason or another, wrote the phrase, <i>The US State Puzzle To Which We Have Never 
    Not Pledged Allegiance</i> into my ideas list. I knew it would be a puzzle which would kind of spoof the stateside-centric 
    head-scratchers.</p>

<p>This idea marinated for a while; I knew I wanted to use the (extremely well-documented) datasets of state symbols somehow,
    but any individual set of state symbols wouldn't be comprehensive enough to carry an entire puzzle. It was after I solved 
    the extremely excellent puzzle <span class="spoiler">Cheers</span> 
    from the hunt <span class="spoiler">2022 MIT Mystery Hunt</span> that I made the core breakthrough on the solve path I wanted 
    to use.
</p>

<p>I believe a lot in the power of puzzles as vehicles for humour, so I hope that this puzzle made people laugh. It certainly
    made me and my guest co-authors laugh enough to weather the various corrections, data dives, rabbit holes, and endless checking and 
    cross-checking that was required to make this puzzle work.
</p>

<p>Until somewhat late in the hunt-writing process, this puzzle was still entitled <i>The State Puzzle To Which You Have Never Not 
    Pledged Allegiance</i>.</p>

<p>Only one obscure Wikipedia page needed to be updated with correct information in order to make this puzzle work. (According 
    to some hint requests we received during the hunt, maybe we should have updated a few more.)
